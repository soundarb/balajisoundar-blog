### Be Original

The composers that you love and look up to didn’t get where they are now by copying others.  Dig deep within yourself and find your own music!  A great piece cannot be imitated.  You need to be inventive and creative!

### Be inspirational and have a purpose

The composers that you love and look up to didn’t get where they are now by copying others.  Dig deep within yourself and find your own music!  A great piece cannot be imitated.  You need to be inventive and creative!

### Be emotional and intellectual

A great composer’s music needs to create an emotional response.  If it is bland, boring, or predictable, the audience will not be able to connect to it.

### Be willing to work hard

Composers can work anywhere from 60-120 hours a week depending on the difficulty of the project.  You have to be willing to put in the time!

### Use good technique and a high level of skill

To be considered a great composer, your music must be structurally sound and it must be harmonically interesting.  It does not hurt to go to school so that you can understand the mechanics of music.  Besides, college can help you get your foot in the door of the industry with the things you learn and the people you meet!  

Also, keep up to date on recording, editing, and sampling software and understand the language of the medium.  You can use software such as Logic Pro to write, score, and program music.

### Use contrast

To be interesting to listen to, your music needs a variety of tone, colour, themes, and tempos.  You should also write for as many different mediums as possible to increase your exposure.

### Promote

Don’t be afraid to self-promote yourself!  There is very little in the way of management for musicians today.  If you want to get your music out there, chances are it is going to be up to you.

### Be open-minded when it comes to publishing

Composers often have an agreement with a publisher, who licenses the piece of music, collects royalties and fees, and pays the composer a percentage of the income.  Copyright of the song is transferred over to the publisher as well.  But, some composers will publish their music themselves, rather than giving up the rights and part of the royalties.  You can do this too with the help of an attorney or manager.

### Don't be afraid of rejection

Be prepared that you may hear a thousand no’s before you hear a yes.  Have a sense of humour.  It will get you though the tough times.  Take your work seriously, but don’t take yourself too seriously!

### Practice, Practice, Practice

Practice, practice, practice, practice makes perfect!!

### Listen

Yes, as I said earlier you need to be original in your composing, but listening to other composers’ scores and pieces can give you knowledge to lead you down the right path for your music.  It could be considered a road map or blueprint.  It will show you how others have constructed music.

### Be curious, learn from each other

Your musician friends can be your best resource when composing!  Stay in contact with them and ask questions.  You all can learn from each other!

Finally it’s not easy to make a career out of composing music.  If it is a dream of yours to become a famous composer Never Give Up!
