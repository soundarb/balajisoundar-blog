Building the dexterity of the fingers and hands will do wonders for playing piano especially to young pianists / players.

### Scales and Arpeggios

Kick-off your practice with playing scales and arpeggios. Because they help you to fortify knowledge of the notes in each key signature, and develop finger strength & rhythm. Play scales (major, minor, chromatic, pentatonic, blues) and arpeggios (major, minor) with hands separately and together in variety of ways:

  - legato (notes played smooth and connected)
  - staccato (notes played short and detached)
  - regular rhythm
  - alternative rhythm (e.g. hold the first note of each octave for longer than the other six notes)
  - alternative accents (e.g. every third or fourth note)
  - contrary motion (starting from same note with right hand plays ascending notes while left hand plays descending notes)

### Stretches

  - Play two notes of at least an octave apart, with thumb and little finger
  - Play a third note somewhere in between, with another finger
  - Jump staccato from the lower to the higher note and back
  - Hold thumb down on one note and play ascending staccato notes as far as possible with one of your fingers

### Improve your weaker hand

Many pianists have one hand that is weaker than the other. Scales will definitely help, because practicing parts usually played by your stronger hand.

### Improve your weaker fingers

Usually, little finger is weaker than the other fingers in the hand. It's difficult to maintain consistency while playing the notes if you have different finger strengths. To overcome this problem:

  - Practice playing scales with consistent touch velocity across all fingers.
  - Play two alternative notes with your weakest finger and a stronger finger. Maintain a consistent rhythm and touch velocity.
  - Play a run of three notes with your weakest finger and two stronger fingers. Again, maintain consistent rhythm and touch velocity.

### Key and Tempo

Play pieces or phrases of music (you know well) at different tempos in different keys.

  - Dexterity can be challenged at faster tempos.
  - Steady rhythm can be challenged as tempos change.
  - Different fingers can be stretched and strengthened when a piece of music is played in a new key.

If you would like to improve the strength of your fingers, try working out on these piano finger exercises when you sit down to practice. With continuous practice, you can train your muscles which apparently builds a muscle memory. The objective is to make the instrument become part of you so that music will flow in you fingers naturally.
