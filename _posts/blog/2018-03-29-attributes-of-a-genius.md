Throughout your wakeful state be AWARE of all your thoughts, feelings, and action.

Always have a project in hand and saturate all your CONSCIOUSNESS on it.

THINK more about the implementation of the project rather than FEELING about the problems to be confronted.

Get CREATIVE IDEAS by thinking more and being flexible.

FORGET YOURSELF completely and devote all your attention to achieve something GREAT and OUTSTANDING in life.

Always try to learn MORE.

Never consider yourself a FINISHED PRODUCT. Constantly endeavor to improve your VALUE.

Never be afraid of FAILURE. Consider failure an opportunity for GROWTH. People are not failures; they only quit trying. PERSEVERE.

Apply IMAGINATION to whatever you do.

Don't strive for PERFECTION. Just do anything well.

Consider life a JOURNEY and not a destination. Maintain a steady pace FORWARDS.

Just do things for the JOY OF DOING them. Don't seek honors.

Don't be perturbed by the opinion of others. Always DO THE BEST you can and don't put off by what others say.

Accept yourself as a UNIQUE product. No one is superior to you. No one is inferior to you. You are what you are.

Be a CHILD. Be light like vapors. Enjoy every moment.

ACCEPT others as they are.

ELIMINATE emotions that are self-destructive.

NEVER ARGUE. Everyone is right from his or her point of view. Trying to convince others is futile.

Concentrate on ACHIEVEMENT rather than on PROSPERITY. Money, position, award or reward should not be your prime concern. Your work should give you that INTERNAL SATISFACTION.

THINK GLOBALLY. Don't confine yourself to boundaries, political, racial or religious.

A genius works for the improvement of the whole human race!
