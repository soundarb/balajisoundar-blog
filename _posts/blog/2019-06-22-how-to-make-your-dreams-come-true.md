I wanted to write this topic for a very long time but the content has got dusted in my shelf for years. Itâ€™s not too late to publish so *here we go*!

Almost everyone of us is guilty of using two dangerous words more often than necessary, and that has not let us open the door when opportunity knocked. Those two words are, *I CAN'T*.

**How to make your dreams come true?** The practical answer is: Don't sleep too much. Secondly, believe in yourself. The sky is the limit to what we can accomplish. The only limitations are what we set for ourselves or what we let others set for us.

I believe that one of the most powerful forces in the world is the will of the man who believes in himself, who dares to aim high, to go confidently after the things he wants from life.

The gap between what a man thinks he can achieve and what is actually possible to him is very very small. But first he must believe that he can. I do have a firm conviction that almost anyone can do what he really believes that he can do. The nature of the goal really makes little difference. There is no way to know for sure, of course but I believe that the result would be very the same, whatever the goal. *The point is that there are no areas in life that are immune to the combination of faith and effort*. The personal philosophy of 'I can' applies to everything that you can name - it cuts across all lines.

I look back on my life and it seems that more than any one single lesson, my experiences have conspired to teach me the value of determined, confident effort taught me the excitement of "I can".

*One never knows what he might accomplish unless he tries*. This is so simple that most people overlook it. If we listen to all the logical reasoning from ourselves and others we will never attempt anything. We would give up even before we start and to this day assume that we could not have made a go of it. We would still sit and talk about that great idea that did not work. Instead we have to put our minds to doing the thing we set out to do, instead of just sitting and talking about it.

*Give things a chance to happen! Give success a chance to happen!* It is impossible to win a race unless you venture to run, impossible to win a victory unless you dare to battle. No life is more tragic than that of the individual who nurses a dream, an ambition, always wishing and hoping, but never giving it a chance to happen. He nurses a flickering dream but never lets it break into a flame.

There are a million more who nurture private, almost secret dreams, the school teacher who wants to go back for a Masters degree; the small businessman who dreams of expanding his business; the couple who have intended to make that trip to Europe; the housewife whose ambition is to write short stories for the freelance market. The list could go on and on. People dream but never daring, never willing to say "I can", never trusting their dreams to the real world of action and effort-people, in short, who are so afraid of failure that they fail.

*The only thing that stands between a man and what he wants from life is often merely the will to try it and the faith to believe that it is possible*.

Why do so many people let their dreams die unlived? The biggest reason, I suppose is, the negative, cynical attitudes of other people. These other people are no enemies-they are friends, even family members. Our enemies never bother us greatly; we can usually handle them with little trouble. But our friends, if they are naysayers, constantly punching holes in our dreams with a cynical smile here, a put-down there, a constant stream of negative vibrations there - our friends can kill us! A man gets excited about a new job. He seeks the opportunity to make more money, do more meaningful work, rise to a personal challenge; the old heart starts pounding and the juices begin to flow and he feels himself revving up for this stimulating new prospect. But then he tells his neighbor about it over the back fence one evening. He gets a smirk, a laugh that says "you can't do that", a foot long list of all the problems and obstacles, and fifty reasons why he will never make it and is better off to stay where he is.

Before he knows it, his enthusiasm falls down to near zero. He goes back into the house like a whipped pup with his tail dragging down and all the fire and self-confidence is gone and he begins to second-guess himself. Now he is thinking of all the reasons that he can't make it instead of the reasons that he can. He lets one five-minute spiel of negativism or ridicule or just plain disbelief from a dream nothing, do nothing neighbor take the steam out of his engine. Friends like that can do more damage than a dozen enemies.

*Remember that the easiest thing to find on God's green earth is someone to tell you all the things you cannot do*. Someone will always be eager to point to you, perhaps with just a look or a tone of voice, that anything new or daring that you try is hopelessly doomed to failure. DON'T LISTEN TO THEM! It is always the fellow who has never made ten thousand dollars who will tell you why you can't make thirty thousand. It is the college flunk-out who will tell you why and how you are too dumb to get that degree; the fellow who never ran a business who can best describe the obstacles that make it impossible to get started. Don't listen to them!

*If you have a dream, whatever it is, dare to believe it and try it*. Give it a chance to happen! Don't let the guys who lie on the couch and watch television every night tell you how futile life is. Don't let your plumber or your fishing buddy or the guy in the next office rob you of that faith in yourself that make things happen.

*If you have that flame of a dream down inside you somewhere, don't let anyone else blow it out, do something about it*.

**Believe you can**, and you'll find that you can. **Be a man of action**! You'll be surprised at how many good things can happen.
