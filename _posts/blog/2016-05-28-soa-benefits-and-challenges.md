## Definition

SOA is an application architecture based on standards, designed to achieve loose coupling, among interacting software applications providing greater flexibility in developing, integrating and managing enterprise applications and thus reduce costs.

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is complex, and one of its main characteristics is that a SOA system is comprised of multiple applications that are combined to accomplish critical business processes. Discussions of SOA can quickly grow so complex that the system's main benefits to an organization are difficult to fully understand.

## Two central questions to be addressed

- How do business process management tools create an SOA architecture that helps your business work more efficiently and productively on a global scale?
- What is the practical value of the solutions that SOA brings to the work people do across global enterprises?

The term Service-Oriented Architecture refers to the use of multiple small-scale computer applications called services that are combined to process data and that work together no matter what computer technologies and applications called vertical silos that serve as all-in-one solutions for organizations. Rather than developing big applications or buying expensive single products, a company can assemble an SOA — an information infrastructure drawn from different services to create a business solution.

## SOA’s main advantages

By combining applications, you can implement solutions incrementally, which saves money. You give your customers flexibility by providing them with familiar applications, such as Web-based services, that let them make purchases, check inventory, or perform other functions. A multinational organization that uses SOA typically finds it easier to work globally, and can grow and change more quickly, because it can add and remove components from its SOA architecture as needed.

But the fact that SOA makes use of disparate applications that make use of different computing environments presents business managers with challenges. Applications that have many different formats with different storage requirements might mean that you have no single tool to visualize what those applications are doing and to adjust how they work. The essential business functions of auditing, analysis, and growth are made more difficult, not easier.

## Business Benefits

SOA systems are cost-effective because they can be implemented in stages. They make use of programming languages in which developers all over the world are fluent. They are highly scalable and can be changed easily because they are made of multiple components. But what are the practical benefits to the way your company does business?

Some of the most important advantages are listed below:

+ Simplified and productive development experience.
+ Simplified assets management and discovery
+ Impact analysis and change management
+ Performance and scalability
+ Common service infrastructure
+ Real-time processing and real-time agility

SOA allows companies to combine standard front-end applications like Web browsers with back-end database functions and a variety of middleware services. The resulting integration, based on standards, enables developers to string together end-to-end solutions across a global infrastructure. Day-to-day business processes are streamlined and can be managed more tightly. Once a solution for SOA is implemented, the business value is no longer obscured by its complex architecture; it becomes obvious to all who need to use it.
