How many of us can say yes to that. It need not be; we are meant to live to 100. It is known that man has the genetic program for 100 years. Scientists have done further research and interestingly fixed the upper limit for the human life at 120.

So why then do most of us never reach the age we were meant to. The fact that quite a few have not only reached that age but have also lived past that simply implies that it is possible and more so tickles us to find out HOW they did it. Yes, for every accomplishment there are set principles. What are they? How to apply them? What's preventing us from applying them?

Dr. Diana S. Woodruff in her beautiful book, CAN YOU LIVE TO BE 100 gives us scientific information and guidelines to apply the principles on how we can live to celebrate our 100th birthday.

**Who wants to live to be 100 anyway?** -- is the attitude shared by many. They say that they would rather die quickly and young rather than experience the indignities of old age. This attitude reflects the thinking to the past than to the future. The notion that disability and senility are the inevitable accompaniments of old age, persists as a stereotype than scientific truth.

Medical advances are making it possible for us to be healthy and vigorous in our 70's, 80's and beyond by early diagnosis. Improvements in the field of education, standard of living and increasing awareness of financial needs after retirement are creating generation of individuals who are better prepared for old age.

10 factors that influence longevity:

- Heredity
- Smoking
- Stress
- Exercise
- Education,
- Body Weight
- Alcohol
- Nutrition
- Occupation
- Lifestyle

Thus, given the changing social climate and the new prospects for health and financial security in old age, the opportunity to live to be 100 becomes more desirable. The aim is now to keep the possibility in mind, and to met the requirement that those 100 years be happy and productive.
