The beginning of any journey is deciding where you want to go. The beginning of the life you want is deciding first as to what precisely you want in life. This is first fundamental and basic step you have to take in making a success of your life. After deciding first as to what you want, you get your maps out and chart your best route to your destination. Read, observe, listen and learn as much as possible about the job, about the route and about what you are after. Knowledge is power, knowledge is strength, and knowledge supplies you the know how. To derive full benefit out of your knowledge, you must act, work hard and put in sustained effort, becoming wiser by experience in the process.

Everything depends on you. You can learn anything you wish, master any trade you select, provided your heart is in it, and you earnestly want to make success of it. You can teach yourself practically anything if your heart sincerely yearns for it. Lack of opportunities never bothers men who are firmly set on getting ahead. They will create the opportunities by themselves, and make their way to success.

Action embodied in one's effort is the real key for one's success as well as happiness. There is no success and resultant happiness without action. Action or effort may not sometime produce the desired result but happiness and success can never come without action or effort. What is more, you can desire satisfaction and happiness in having done your best even though the results did not turn out to be as expected as possible. Do your work unmindful of your results.

No man can expect a very easy life and also at the same time a very successful one. The rewards one gets in life are usually commensurate with effort one puts in. It is something astonishing what intelligent effort can accomplish when channelised in the right direction. Success is not easy, if it was every one would be successful however the success ladder is not as difficult to climb, as it might seem. Each time we overcome an obstacle or solve a problem, the tasks we are attempting become easier, till finally what once looked impossible becomes routine.

Countless efforts by themselves, despite countless falls, imply the power to rise. When we are at the bottom of the ladder, the top seems to be inaccessible and the obstacles to the top insuperable. But they are not, if the early conquest are toughest. The more you succeed, the easier it becomes to do so, till eventually success grows into a habit. Thus success follows success. Nothing is impossible for man with a purpose and the determination to persist with it. Be with confidence, courage and firm determination.

One of the ingredients that make for success is hard work. But if you like and love your work, you will never find it hard or boring; no matter how long you happen to be at it. There is no substitute for hard work. Any knowledge you may acquire or any skill you may develop will be the result of consistent effort. No point in deluding yourself that success can be hard easily or should be a purpose to all work, and a worthy goal at which to aim and advance.

Never venture; never win. No risk; no gain. Fortune favours the brave. In life we have to take bold decisions and take them quickly. The weak, the timid and the undecided are swept aside by the tide of events; concentration and determination can enable us to attain success in any field. Success is not a matter of luck or genius; it depends on adequate preparation and indomitable determination.

Display courage, confidence and boldness. To achieve success, make progress, and gain profits, one has to dare and take risks. Do not be afraid to take calculated risks. Be innovative, spot the opportunities and make full use of them. Keep your eyes, ears and above all your mind open. Be observant and listen with interest. Be enthusiastic, energetic and positive. Join hands with the right people and build a good team. Teamwork pays better and yield higher dividend than solo effort. To make the best or optimum use of your energy and resource, you must act to a plan, and re-appraise and evaluate your progress at regular intervals. There is always room for improvement and one can learn from one's mistake.

The longest journey begins but with the first step. Thus, the only way to get started is to start by taking this most important first step. Once started, the momentum will gather and things will begin moving on their own. You must overcome the initial inertia and inclination to delay, postpone and procrastinate. There is no shortcut or magic formula to get started and reach your goal other than taking a bold plunge by the exercise of your sheer will power.

'I will drink the ocean' says the persevering soul. 'At my will the mountains will crumble up' have that sort of energy.

Rely on yourself; stand on your own legs.
