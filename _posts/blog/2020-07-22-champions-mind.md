How can one event happen to two people, yet one emerge stronger than ever and the other shattered and broken?

One Word: **MINDSET**

## Reverse Conventions

Just because things have been done a certain way for a certain amount of time doesn't mean there is a reason for it. Actively question conventional thinking and ask internal questions to evaluate actions and paths for yourself. Not knowing your weaknesses is really what will keep you from where you want to be. You can discover your weaknesses through your actions and focus.

## Action Oriented

Create an empowering narrative to allow you aim higher. You are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with. Make sure you are surrounded with great influences, because you will learn subconsciously from them. Put yourself in the shoes of a future you can help create focus, orientation towards goals, and resist temptation. Follow an action-oriented framework after defining your overarching goals. Then tie them to the emotions associated with the goals instead of the goals themselves for maximum commitment and motivation.

## Improvise Productivity

Our brains do an incredible amount of work when we sleep. They make connections that improve performance, so optimizing sleep is imperative to massive success. Create marginal gains by focusing on the 1% improvements in every aspect apparently they will compound. With a certain amount of confidence, it's important to forget the insecure actions that got us to where we are. Separate the emotion from the actions and you will perform better.

## Take Ownership

Very few of us are going to succeed on the basis of one singular skill. Therefore, seek to cultivate at least two secondary skills that can enhance your primary skill. This follows the pattern of how most successful people are in real life. Hold all the responsibility in your own shoulders, create a very difficult kind of drive and motivation than you would have otherwise.

## Warrior Mindset

There are six fundamental human needs, two of which we emphasize at any given time: certainty, uncertainty, significance, connection, growth, and contribution. Truly prepare for the worst, but hope for the best. Do not depend or rely on the best-case scenario. Have a warrior mindset. "I will drink the ocean" says the persevering soul. "At my will mountains will crumble up" have that sort of energy.

## Manage Energy Not Time

There are conventional linear paths, slightly less conventional paths, and paths which you arrive to through necessity and thinking outside the box. People most often fail because they lack the ability to approach problems from alternative angles. Time is limited, but energy is even more limited. Manage your energy levels and zones of productivity during the day to make sure you take advantage of them.

**In Reality**, Life doesn't grant us the ability to choose what happens, but we will always have the ability to choose our mindset and how to respond. It is the one element no one can take from you and that separates peak performers from the rest of the field. It's an essential building block of any champion.

What are you waiting for? March on the roads to champion's world.

Because..........It's your turn :)
