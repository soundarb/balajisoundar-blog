Hello there

I am a software architect and technology evangelist with 15+ years of overall experience in software development and engineering. I have strong work experience in building an enterprise grade high-scale software systems that includes integrated flight tracking, retail, insurance and manufacturing industry applications.

I am an AWS certified Solutions Architect Professional with experience in cloud native application development.

I started programming in my college days, as a C programmer. [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie) and [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds) are my inspirations.

I have recently started my contributions to open source projects. My first open source project forked for contribution is [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

I am a musician by passion. I am an accredited Trinity Music Exams Coach for western classical music theory and electronic keyboard instrumental. I perform on stages as a lead vocalist and a keyboard player.

Details of my music conservatory can be found [here](https://www.facebook.com/crotchetmusiqconservatory/).

I like to keep abreast with technology news. I devote most of my leisure time reading the books of [Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi](https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org). I am also an ardent fan of comedy legend [Goundamani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goundamani) and music maestro [Ilayaraaja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilaiyaraaja) and academy award winner [A.R.Rahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman).

Thanks for stopping by...
